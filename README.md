##### The Grid/Game Table:
* Central to the entire concept is the game interface itself. It features a conventional Noughts and Crosses grid table, adorned with color styles harmonizing with the overall webpage design while maintaining clarity in each boxed section. When a player clicks on a designated box, a graphical representation of either a skull or crossbone, contingent on the active turn, will be showcased. Once a winner is determined, users will no longer have the option to select additional boxes, and the pertinent information will seamlessly transition to the scoreboards section.

Each player is labelled with both their graphic and text, there is also a graphic for the tied section.
the text colour is all in Red but the numeral score colour is matched to the colour of the graphic for either skull, tie or croossbone.

##### Reset button - Confirmation:
* Upon clicking the button, not only will the colors on the button undergo a change, but a pop-up will also appear, prompting the user to confirm their intention to initiate a new game. If the user proceeds with confirmation, the board will be reset, clearing all graphics. In the event of cancellation, the game will persist in its previous state.

## UX/UI SECTION
### Futrue Features
* Following three distinct focus groups involving trial runs with diverse user types and their invaluable feedback on the final game, potential enhancements for the future include:

##### Player vs. Computer Option
* Currently, the game supports multiplayer on a shared screen. In future updates, there is a plan to introduce the option for players to face off against the computer, expanding the gaming experience to player vs. computer and player vs. player modes.
  
##### Keyboard Control:
* Although initially considered with lower priority due to time constraints, future iterations may incorporate keyboard controls for desktop users. This enhancement aims to allow users to make moves using keyboard commands, such as Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C, providing an alternative and potentially more accessible method for playing the game.

##### Styled Confirmation Pop-Up:
* Future plans for the confirmation pop-up involve refining its appearance to better align with the overall aesthetic of the webpage. This entails incorporating stylistic elements that enhance the visual appeal, moving away from a plain and generic appearance.

##### Winner Display:
* Upon winning a round, future updates aim to deliver a more impactful and celebratory experience for the player. Potential ideas include:
* Traditional Naughts and Crosses procedures, such as lines going through the winner.
* A visually engaging pop-up display at the center of the screen with graphic elements.
This enhancement is designed to elevate the user experience, making the act of winning more memorable and enjoyable.
